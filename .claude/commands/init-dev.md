description: Initialize development session by reading project context and displaying available commands
---

Read the chats-summary.txt file from the parent directory (/Users/ashikkizhakkepallathu/Documents/claude/jellypig/chats-summary.txt) to understand the project context, then display a quick summary of what you can help with.

Steps:
1. Read /Users/ashikkizhakkepallathu/Documents/claude/jellypig/chats-summary.txt
2. Display a concise summary including:
   - Project name and description
   - Available custom slash commands (/sim, etc.)
   - Recent features implemented
   - Key configuration details
   - Common tasks you can help with

Make the output brief and actionable - focus on what's immediately useful for the developer.
